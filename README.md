Harry Potter Themed 

Hogwarts Hub — Final Project
This project is a Harry Potter–themed website built using Bootstrap 5 to demonstrate component-based design and modern framework integration. The site includes required Bootstrap components, responsive layout, and minimal custom CSS.

🔮 Bootstrap Components Used
Required Components:
- Carousel
- Modal
- Accordion
- Tabs
- Popovers
Additional Component:
- Collapse (Books vs Movies section)

🎨 Custom CSS Explanation
I used very minimal custom CSS, only for:
- Font family (serif theme to match the Harry Potter aesthetic)
- Background gradient for a magical dark atmosphere
All layout, spacing, borders, colors, and responsiveness were handled using Bootstrap utilities.

🧩 Most Challenging Component
Popovers
They required JavaScript initialization, and I had to make sure the attributes were correct (data-bs-toggle="popover" and data-bs-content). Once initialized, they worked smoothly.

✨ Easiest Component
Tabs
Bootstrap handles tabs automatically with data attributes, so I only needed to structure the HTML correctly. No custom JS was required.

⚙️ How Bootstrap Improved My Code
- Reduced the amount of custom CSS I needed to write
- Made the layout responsive without media queries
- Allowed me to build polished components quickly
- Helped keep my code organized and modular

❤️ Framework Features I Liked
- Utility classes for spacing, borders, and colors
- Built-in components like Carousel and Accordion
- Easy JavaScript activation for interactive elements
👎 Features I Liked Less
- Popovers requiring manual JS initialization
- Some components needing specific structure to work correctly
